            <p>I've spent the last several years turning big ideas into stories people actually care about. Across <strong>30+ campaigns</strong>, I've learned that the <strong>magic happens</strong> when you stop talking at consumers and start talking with them.</p>

            <p>Whether that's demystifying AI or making enterprise software feel surprisingly human.</p>

            <p>My sweet spot? That messy, beautiful intersection where product geeks, creative minds, and business strategists collide to create something that doesn't just launch: <strong>it lands!</strong></p>
