REVISED INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRAE - Better Legacy of the Bounce Section

## What's Different:
This revision combines the redundant sections into one cohesive "From Bounce to Brand Identity" section that includes:
- A single, elegant timeline-based carousel 
- All images with proper captions (hover overlays)
- Timeline badges showing years (2020-2024)
- Progress bar showing evolution timeline
- Better visual hierarchy and flow
- Removes redundancy between sections

## Step 1: Remove Existing Legacy Section
FIRST, remove any existing "Legacy of the Bounce" section that was previously added.

## Step 2: Replace "From Bounce to Brand Identity" Section  
Replace the current "From Bounce to Brand Identity" section (after the video section) with the content from "revised_html_section.html"

## Step 3: Update Image Paths
In the HTML, update these placeholder image paths with your actual filenames (in numbered order 01-09):

Replace:
- assets/images/01_original_campaign.jpg
- assets/images/02_suite_focus.jpg  
- assets/images/03_refined.jpg
- assets/images/04_cohesion.jpg
- assets/images/05_unified.jpg
- assets/images/06_versatility.jpg
- assets/images/06a_additional.jpg  (this is the 6a file you mentioned)
- assets/images/07_allinone.jpg
- assets/images/08_commercial.jpg
- assets/images/09_copilot.jpg

With the actual filenames from your directory (following the numbered sequence you mentioned).

## Step 4: Add CSS Styles
Copy content from "revised_css_styles.css" and add to your existing <style> section.
NOTE: This REPLACES any previous legacy/bounce CSS you may have added.

## Step 5: Add JavaScript  
Copy content from "revised_javascript_code.js" and add to your existing <script> section.
NOTE: This REPLACES any previous legacy carousel JavaScript.

## Step 6: Update Scroll Targets
In your scrollTargets array, change '.legacy-bounce' to '.bounce-to-legacy':

const scrollTargets = [
    '.project-overview',
    '.campaign-section', 
    '.video-section',
    '.brand-identity',
    '.evolution-gallery',
    '.bounce-to-legacy',  // CHANGE TO THIS
    '.visual-impact',
    '.reflection',
    '.cta-section'
];

## What You'll Get:
✅ One cohesive section instead of redundant content
✅ Timeline-based carousel with year badges
✅ All 10 images with proper hover captions
✅ Progress bar showing evolution timeline
✅ Better visual hierarchy
✅ Responsive design
✅ Auto-play functionality
